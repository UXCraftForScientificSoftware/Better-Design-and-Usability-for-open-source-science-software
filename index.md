User Experience Research (UXR) is an essential part of improving how software works for the people that use it. The 'User Experience' is the subjective experience in which humans interact, understand and manipulate information and interfaces. Research is investigating and interpreting those experiences of the users, from their own perspectives and then applying those learnings to the software to make it work well for the people using it. People all use software in different ways, with different intentions and purposes at different paces. Learning how to do UX Research helps creators of software to think outside their own experiences and include those of a wide range of users.

There might be new terminology or new ways that words and terms are used in these lessons. Please refer to the [Glossary]() which contains words and their meaning in the context of software design.
