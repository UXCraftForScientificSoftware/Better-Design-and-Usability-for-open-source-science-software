## Recruitment strategy and refining your user audience

[https://sprblm.github.io/devs-guide-to/user-testing/recruiting-testers/](https://sprblm.github.io/devs-guide-to/user-testing/recruiting-testers/)

An essential component of doing user experience research is finding, communicating with and spending time with users to understand and learn from their experiences and perspectives.
In this episode, we cover the essential aspects of recruitment strategy, messaging, scheduling and optional long term planning.

Make sure that you have reviewed and completed the section ['Choose and find your target user audience'](https://uxcraftforscientificsoftware.github.io/Better-Design-and-Usability-for-open-source-science-software/02_Choosing_a_research_method.html#choose-and-find-your-target-user-audience) in the episode ['Choosing a research method'](https://uxcraftforscientificsoftware.github.io/Better-Design-and-Usability-for-open-source-science-software/02_Choosing_a_research_method.html).

Once you have your intentions, goals and needs documented, you can translate that information to recruitment messages to potential users.

First, decide how many users you'd like to start with speaking to. There are no wrong answers here, as stated in the ['Choose and find your target user audience'](https://uxcraftforscientificsoftware.github.io/Better-Design-and-Usability-for-open-source-science-software/02_Choosing_a_research_method.html#choose-and-find-your-target-user-audience) section of the ['Choosing a research method'](https://uxcraftforscientificsoftware.github.io/Better-Design-and-Usability-for-open-source-science-software/02_Choosing_a_research_method.html), this is about you deciding how many users you want to speak to in order for you to feel comfortable with the data you've gathered and to use that data to make informed design decisions about your open source science software. You can start with a low number and then increase that should you gather interesting and valid user participants.

It's also useful to set time-lines for your 'data gathering' phase, this helps the potential user participants better align with a timeline in their schedule. When you make timelines flexible to your potential user participants, you can risk the data gathering phase being very long or the user participants having long gaps between the data gathering. This can sometimes mean factors can change your original conditions for your user experience research.

Deciding the duration of each test helps the team and your participants manage expectations. We like to do 20-minute, 30-minute, or 45-minute tests, depending on the size of the task. Remember to give yourself some buffer time and end the test promptly at the time limit to respect the participant's time. Don't feel the need to schedule test sessions back to back - give your team a break between sessions.

Testing can be done in-person and remotely. We recommend that everyone's face is visible (unless anonymity is crucial) and you all can see what's being tested. If you give a phone or a laptop to the user, sit next to them (if culturally appropriate) so that you can watch the process. If the testing is remote, you can share your screen (the participant verbally gives commands while you perform the operations) or ask them to share their screen (making sure to get their consent in advance).

It's good to have an idea of what kinds of characteristics and behaviours the users need to have in order to be most useful and informative to you in the test scenario. The balance here is to make sure you are not setting too restrictive characteristics and behaviours so that users self-select out of the running to test. Here we want to reassure users about the eligibility criteria you are setting and that even if they deem themselves 'less proficient' that you may still want to learn from them. We'll explore how to word these needs inclusively and openly when we come to craft recruitment messages and screener surveys.

Describe the parameters that you'll start with for your user experience research. Answering the following questions with short, simple answers will help you develop these parameters.


1. How many days/weeks for gathering data 
2. How many days/weeks for sourcing user participants
3. How long do you intend for the user experience research session to last? e.g. 20 mins, 60 mins etc.
4. Should the users be accessible in person, online or both? 

Describe the details of what your users need in order to provide you with useful insight to help you make informed design decisions. The following prompts can help you define this but you may also want to define your own criteria.

1. What kind of scientific/research work should the user be doing?
2. What kind of software and/or system requirements and proficiency should they ideally have? (remember, if you ask some user to rate their proficiency they sometime self-select out of the process because they consider their skills to be 'lacking')
3. Alternatively, how many times (if any) should they have used a specific technology or software?
4. What kind of background knowledge should the user have if any? e.g. The user should have experience of using API endpoints, of R statistical programming etc.
5. What other details are important to your user experience research? e.g. They should work in a lab setting, they should be a current researcher in an institution, they should have published papers etc.

## Finding users

When starting your outreach to potential user participants, you can first make a list of possible outreach channels where your community gathers, such as: a specific software or community email listserv, social media followers, academic citations of your software in published papers, bug reports/issues, related communities on Reddit, forums or Discord, your website visitor analytics or submissions. You might also attend relevant conferences or events related to research, programming languages or your open source scientific software and gather interest in person.

When it comes to finding users that you are't already aware of, such as users outside of your research domain or professional and social circles, creating a lower stakes 'recruitment' message can be beneficial to have and circulate. These lower stakes recruitment messages typically omit detailed information about the specific user experience research parameters and are more about expanding your own connections and network. 

*'I'm a researcher looking into [specific scientific research subject] at [insert institution, organisation or company] and/or I am building/maintaining [Insert scientific/research software here]. I'm looking to meet and connect with people in [insert region/country] that identity as [insert e.g. new users, researchers in a specific field, people who use OSS, people who code, people learning to code etc.'].'*

Finding users that are 'not online' already can be really difficult. Some of the people that are systematically excluded from technology, including scientific open source software, are those that have unstable, restricted and/or complete lack of access to the internet or the 'free and open' internet. Being aware that across the globe, there will be users in governmental, social or technological ecosystems where access to them will be difficult and their participation in user experience research could put them at risk depending on nuanced and changing attitudes and policies. 


## Crafting Recruitment messaging

There are two versions of a recruitment message, one that is for large audiences to then contact you specifically and one to one messages that you send directly to a specific person that you believe fit the criteria for your user experience research.

**Sample script for a large audience recruitment message**
*Are you familiar with [topic/goal/research question to test]? We want to talk to you.*
*I'm [tool team member name], part of the team at [our tool/software]. We are working on a new feature and we'd like your help to test it out. We'd like to speak with you for [Time interval e.g. 10 - 20 min] and have you try it. Thank you! If you are interested and able to help, send me an email: [email address].*

**More info**
**Who can be a tester?** *People who use [tool/software] and/or are familiar with [particular technology].*
**What is [tool/software]?** *[One sentence about your tool/software]*
**Do I need to prepare?** Nope! Come as you are.*
**Is it private?** *Of course. We will not be recording voice or video. We will be taking brief notes about what works and what doesn't in the design so that we can make improvements. We will not share your identity with anyone.*

**Alternative sample script for a large audience recruitment message**
*Hello everybody! Have you ever [activity/feature you are targeting]? If you want to help improve [tool/software], read on!*
*My colleagues and I at [tool/project] want to speak for [Time interval e.g. 10 - 20 min] with a few people who have [experience you want to target].*
*If you're interested please fill out this short form: [add a link to a form]*

**Sample script for a one to one recruitment message**
*Do you have [Time interval e.g. 10 - 20 min] and use [software]? We'd like your help!*
*We are about to release a new version of [our tool/software] and want to hear from you. To help us understand your needs and how to improve [our tool/software], we'd like to hear about your experiences with the tool (whether you've used it for a long time or just recently started using it!).*

*We're booking [Time interval e.g. 10 - 20 min] conversations to better understand how to improve [our tool/software] for everyone. If you're able to participate, please fill out this simple form [add a link to a form].*

Back to Zarah and Ester. Zarah has discovered that Ester has had to ‘hack’ the open source scientific software in order to enter specific environmental data for the ocean-based plants Ester is researching. Zarah would like to understand if offering flexible data entry options for people like Ester would be the best feature to improve the software’s usability or if the bugs that Ester identified require other considerations.

## Key points

### Recruitment strategy and refining your user audience

- Defining your parameters, timings and criteria for who you intend to do user experience research with as well as the behaviours and characteristic preferences of the users.

### Finding users

- Consider building your network and contacts casually through channels you don’t typically engage with and asking people you know who might have broader connections to gain access to users and communities you don’t typically inhabit.
- Be aware and respond appropriately to the complex and changing nature of global access to the internet. Many people do not have free and unrestricted access to the internet in order to participate in user experience research.
