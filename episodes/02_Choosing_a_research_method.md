## Questions

  - What distinguishes any method from another, e.g. are there different user experience method types? 
  - How will learners know which methods are the right ones for their user experience research?
  - What ethical considerations do learners need to take into account when choosing a user experience method?
  - How can a user experience research plan affect method selection?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

## Objectives

  - Articulate your motivation for conducting user experience research
  - Define a target user audience for the user experience research
  - Develop an appropriate recruitment strategy based on the chosen target user audience
  - Identify potential risks of participation in user experience research and ways of addressing those risks
  - Identify who (if anyone) will conduct and assist with your user experience research
  - Determine what method (or methods) are appropriate for your open source scientific software

## What is your motivation and/or or goals for doing user experience research?

In the [introductions example](https://uxcraftforscientificsoftware.github.io/Better-Design-and-Usability-for-open-source-science-software/introduction.html#problem-scenario), Zarah’s motivation for doing user Experience Research was partly because she saw lots of bugs being described by other users of her open source scientific software and partly a curiosity to learn and understand a user (Ester) that uses her open source scientific software differently does their own work.

Zarah is interested in solving current documented problems for herself and other users and also exploring what other potential problems users that are not like Zarah could come across now or in the future. Zarah is motivated by both the now and improving for the future.
