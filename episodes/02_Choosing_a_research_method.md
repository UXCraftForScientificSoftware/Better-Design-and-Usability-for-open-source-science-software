:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

## Questions

  - What distinguishes any method from another, e.g. are there different user experience method types? 
  - How will learners know which methods are the right ones for their user experience research?
  - What ethical considerations do learners need to take into account when choosing a user experience method?
  - How can a user experience research plan affect method selection?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

## Objectives

  - Articulate your motivation for conducting user experience research
  - Define a target user audience for the user experience research
  - Develop an appropriate recruitment strategy based on the chosen target user audience
  - Identify potential risks of participation in user experience research and ways of addressing those risks
  - Identify who (if anyone) will conduct and assist with your user experience research
  - Determine what method (or methods) are appropriate for your open source scientific software

## What is your motivation and/or or goals for doing user experience research?

In the [introductions example](https://uxcraftforscientificsoftware.github.io/Better-Design-and-Usability-for-open-source-science-software/introduction.html#problem-scenario), Zarah’s motivation for doing user Experience Research was partly because she saw lots of bugs being described by other users of her open source scientific software and partly a curiosity to learn and understand a user (Ester) that uses her open source scientific software differently does their own work.

Zarah is interested in solving current documented problems for herself and other users and also exploring what other potential problems users that are not like Zarah could come across now or in the future. Zarah is motivated by both the now and improving for the future.

## Questions to ask yourself

- What is your goal? 
- What do you hope to learn? 
- Who do you want to learn from and why?


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

In this exercise you’re going to spend time thinking about your project, whatever stage it’s in (idea mode or a fully working open source science project) and define and describe it. This is a series of simple and clear statements that communicate the intended use of a product or service.

**Zarah’s example**

| **Define your project and who it is primarily for**                                                                                                                              	| For scientists and researchers to measure plant traits (aka phenotypes) from images. It is command/script based and works within some web applications. It creates documents that contain code, outputs and documentation.          	|
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| **Describe what your tool/software does in an ideal scenario**                                                                                                                   	| Ideally a scientist who has images of plants wants to use the tool to batch-process, quickly process or see what plant traits the tool will offer from an image. Ideally they use the commands/prompts in a development environment 	|
| **State one user experience research goal? (e.g. reduce user errors during data input)**                                                                                         	| To ensure that images of plants submerged in water are able to be processed accurately and in a usable way.                                                                                                                         	|
| **List any critical constraints or limitations of your open source scientific software (e.g. It is written in a particular coding language, it cannot do complex computations)** 	| My open source science project is command based and can be used in certain web applications. There is no GUI. It is written in Python. It has certain limitations on what outputs are possible/available.                           	|


**Add your own**

| **Define your project and who it is primarily for**                                                                                                                              	|   	|
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|---	|
| **Describe what your tool/software does in an ideal scenario**                                                                                                                   	|   	|
| **State one user experience research goal? (e.g. reduce user errors during data input)**                                                                                         	|   	|

Do you notice any key words or themes in your answers?

Are there any open questions related to the **‘Questions to ask yourself’** that were difficult to answer?
