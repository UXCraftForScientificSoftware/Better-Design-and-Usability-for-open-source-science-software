## Storing data about users safely and securely

If you are part of an organisation or institution you may already have policies and practices in place to ensure the safety of data associated with your open source scientific software. It’s important to follow these processes above any advised processes and practices here. The advice and guidance contained in this episode are specific and unique elements of user experience research data storage that is often missed by institutions and organisations that are not used to handling this kind of data.

We recommend that you by default limit and restrict what personally identifying information you collect in the user research process. It may be essential to note down, Names, Alias, Institutions/Organizations/Companies and aspects like project names. It is rarely if ever relevant to record detailed demographic information such as age, specific location/address, gender, race/ethnicity and any other personal characteristics. We acknowledge that sometimes these identities and experiences can inform how a user performs their tasks using software and also can be important from a perspective of demonstrating that you are researching with a wide array of users (and not just the same demographics over and over). However, these demographics combined with searchable information across identity databases can lead to unintended risks and consequences for users. This can be as extreme as facing legal action should they have disclosed sensitive information (or information/identities that are criminalised in a specific country) in confidence of the interview process (either inadvertently or purposefully in relation to your research topic) and as mild as your user experience research participants receiving critiques or being called out privately or publicly.

We can’t know all the risks involved with collecting data around our open source science projects, but we can limit the ways in which people disconnected to the user experience research data collection can piece together who a person is from the data that they offer and we can empower our user experience research participants to redact any data that they view as sensitive or might put them at risk. 

When it comes to the logistics of data storage, if your institution or organization does not have policies for secure and private storage already, then consider using, login, password and 2-factor authentication protected services (if you want to store data in the cloud) or login and/or password protected local storage on your device/harddrives. For large files like video and audio, these can be costly to keep locally from a size point of view. Be aware of the limitations of keeping these kinds of files (along with transcriptions) on services like Zoom. Be sure to read the privacy policies and data policies of any services you decide to use if not stipulated by your institution or organization.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

Take a look at the list below. It contains a series of different kinds of data that is possible to collect during user experience research, either purposefully or inadvertently. Note down next to the data type whether this data is needed in order for you to collect usable user data and why, whether it is not needed and whether it could be kept but obscured in a way.


**Example**

**Full Legal Names:** Record initials only or give users a ‘code name’ as a reference, only refer to the user as the code name during data collection and in written data. Codenames alongside known names/aliases are stored in a single, password protected file for approved researcher access.

**Project Name and purpose:** Rather than the explicit project name, you can describe what the project does instead to slightly abstract the project. This only works if the project is specific enough that it cannot be singled out by description.

**Institutional Affiliation:** Record the general sense of the department or that it’s a ‘lab’. Adding a genre such as ‘environmental science’ or otherwise can help both yourself frame the data when you re-read it and also helps orient others should they read any open data. Avoid any direct institutional names, this tends to make user participants less honest about any systemic problems that impact their use of software.

**Country of origin/residence:** Recording timezone like UTC+4 


### Your data types list

**Full Legal Names:**
**Gender, Sex, Race, Ethnicity:**
**Country of origin/residence:**
**Educational level:**
**Experience with coding/technical tool/process:**
**Operating system/other computer set up and details:**

## Maintaining a database of user participants for user experience research

Maintaining a database of your user participants is generally a good practice. Keeping information like who has been involved in user experience research, when on what topics and what contexts can help you when returning to the same/similar features and work that the same person could be beneficial to be input into again. As always however, there are aspects of this data capture and storage that can pose privacy and security issues.
Of course, first look at your own institutions/organizations policies and procedures and review any previous data protection policies you may have written as part of your research/science work. Ensure you are following those should you be required to. 

Next understanding from the previous episode, what kind of data you will capture about who in what ways is critical. Keeping a spreadsheet/database of any highly sensitive identifying information under password and locked systems is highly advisable to avoid any risks of harm to you or your user experience research participants.

We’d advise keeping two separate sets of information. One set where you have highly sensitive information like what the legal/known names, institution names, locations etc. along with what code name or reference word you gave the individual. A second set of information would be the code name and any information that can be readily public and non-risky to share.

**Example of sensitive information to be locked**
**Code name:** Vash
**Real name:** Erik Smith
**Institution:** Project Seeds lab, University of the city of Julai
**Location:** Julai City
**Gender:** Male

**Example of potential public information**
**Name:** Vash
**Field of study:** Environmental Sciences
**Tool tested:** Plantimg
**Educational level:** PhD researcher and Coder
**Experience with coding/technical tool/process:** Proficient in python and common line. Has built own commands and tools.

The above ‘potential public information’ shouldn’t cause any problems for the user experience research participant should it be made public knowledge to assign any of this person's comments. To clarify the risks more clearly, imagine if ‘codename Vash’ spoke about how frustrated he was at his institution's funding of certain sciences and labs in relation to his use for the open source science software that you are asking him about.
This kind of comment, while possibly still relevant to you understanding how you can better your design decisions of your open source scientific software, could seriously harm code name Vash’s personal and professional reputation. So while it might be vital information, understanding when that vital information must be kept private and secure is an ethical and moral imperative for those involved in user experience research.


:::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Understanding how you might plan to recontact people can be an important part of longer-term user experience research thinking. Take some time to read the following questions and how you might re-engage with a past user experience research participant.

- How would you begin a recontact message? What information would you include, summarise and/or what would you omit from a message?

- What happened since the last time you involved this user participant in user experience research? What changes and improvements might have happened that are important?

- What questions would you need your user participant to answer regarding their own changes in this time period? Do you still require them to be involved in certain aspects of science and/or software?


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Ethical user experience research

It’s difficult to define ethical user experience research in broadly applicable terms because, as with most user experience research, your ethics and morals and those of the users involved play a large part in defining those ethics and morals. Again, ensuring you are adhering to the policies and procedures of your institution or organization is critical. Many institutions have ethics processes involved when it comes to research that involve human (and animal) subjects. User experience research involves humans directly in as far as you’re prompting, exploring and investigating the ways in which they perform their tasks and how they interact with the world associated with your open source science software.

Spend some time thinking about what your own boundaries and the boundaries of your science and research project are. Are there certain subjects and topics that might come up, that you will politely refuse to gather data on and advise a user participant to move onto a topic? You can notify potential user participants ahead of time of topics that will not be covered and will not be recorded in notes.
Now consider how you would deal with surprising content or comments that are ethically and morally challenging to you and your work or put the user participant in a position of risk or uncertainty. Modelling and thinking through these potentials should be considered before you undertake user experience research so that you are not caught unprepared in a situation that is unethical or immoral.

**For example:** 
- A user participant may ask you to ‘put a good word in for them’ with a funder or institution that you have a relationship or affiliation with in order for them to participate in your user research. 
- A user participant might speak publicly about some private aspects of your open science research software that you do not want made public yet. 
- A user participant might request a benefit of the open source science software in return for participation. Such as lowered or free access to versions of the software that may be paid or access to any other benefit that has a cost/value attached.
- A user participant discloses some personal circumstances or events that are concerning their physical and/or mental health and/or wellbeing. This is given in the context of what was asked/prompted in regards to their user experience of the open source science software.

In these cases, ensuring you have a signed consent form for participating in user experience research is critical as well as setting out the expectations of user participants when they are involved in the user experience research. [See a templated example here](https://github.com/sprblm/resources/blob/master/research_tools/data-handling-statement.md).



::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

Take a look at the below user experience subjects. Assess whether you foresee an ethical or moral issue with the intended topics.

## Keeping understandable and accessible notes

Ensuring you are keeping understandable and accessible notes is critical to some of the further episodes in this lesson ([Episode: Interpreting results](#)). In that future episode we go into depth about how to tag/label your notes in order to make the process of understanding findings more robust and easy.

Further episodes also look at supplemental ways to help you with data collection and note taking. In [Episode: Conducting Interviews](#), [Episode: Conducting rapid usability assessment](#) and in [Episode: Interpreting results](#), the benefits of automated transcription services are detailed as well as the benefits of inviting another person into the process of data collection in order to focus on note-taking while the other person focuses on asking questions, observing the user participant and being engaged in the data collection process of interacting with the use participant. In order for these future episodes to be most effective, committing at this point to robust note taking where you minimise jargon, shorthand and dedicate notes to ‘plain language’ descriptions and depictions of information presented by user participants can go a long way to ensuring that there is not an information or understanding barriers to reading notes and extracting meaningful data from the data.

Some best practice to make your notes understandable and accessible:

- Have clear and documented titles, question/prompt/topic and data/information text structure. You can do this with text size and styling.

- When you have data that connects to another topic or data, take time to note what those connections are in brackets or another text style or if you can, make the link to the connected data as you go. Using some intelligent systems or tools that have features for linking the same terms can help make this a less manual task.

- Take the time to explain any interpretations of data that are specifically relevant. Again, ensure the text styling here is different to the norm such as using italics, ‘Authors note’ etc.

- Ensuring that you save these notes in a  location that not only follows any policies and procedures that you may need to adhere to from institutions/organizations but if possible making sure those files are accessible and openable by multiple operating systems and softwares, don’t require a stable/consistent internet connection and also are not locked behind logins and/or payment plans.

- Keep a glossary of jargon and terms/acronym that may need explaining to those unfamiliar with the terms. Just because you yourself know a term and its meaning doesn’t mean that other people have the same understanding of a term or acronym. This can also be great to store other meanings of terms via user participants and also great for user participants themselves to access should they want to clarify themselves any terms/acronyms that you or your open source science software uses.

- Where possible, link and reference the tools and/or software mentioned or likely to be mentioned in user participant data. A weblink or similar source material can help with referencing and recall at later dates.


:::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

Take some time to fill out the following table and add any cells to begin to build your glossary or jargon and/or acronyms.

| **Jargon/Acronym/Term** 	| **Meaning/understanding of the Jargon/Acronym/Term** 	| **Reference link or source if applicable** 	|
|-------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------	|

## Open source user experience research

User experience research has rarely been done in very visible open source ways. Unlike the code aspects of open source, user research and design aspects are still finding the routes into open source that are available to them within a tool set and ecosystem that prioritises code.

It is possible to make user experience research open in terms of transparency and adhere to open source principles too. This largely can be summarised by openly sharing what you can in whatever ways are most accessible to you. Thankfully much of user experience research is writing based and therefore sharable in open source repositories as text files or spreadsheet/database files. Occasionally, images and diagrams may be useful to use and these can be linked to or referenced within text.

We recommend utilising issues, folders, labels and all the various features of the repository service of your choice.

Other benefits to working openly and in an open source way with your user experience research is that the user participants that are involved in the user experience research (and also users that are not involved, but interested) can follow the progress of features and improvements that they are interested and invested in - this can help build trust with your users and contributors as well as giving them an opportunity to participate.


## Licensing

When it comes to open licensing your user experience research, you may already have licenses for code-related work that can be applicable to your user experience research. But these software licenses are typically geared towards the code side of things and miss some of the nuances of user experience design. Thinking about anything specific related to how you would want your user experience research to be used as per an open source license is wise. You may want to add addendums to your existing licenses to states that user experience research must be attributed and cannot be monetised as data, for example.


:::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Take a look at your current open source license/s (if you don’t have a license, take a look at one of the [licenses from this list](https://opensource.org/licenses)).

Spend some time thinking about whether you’d want a specific license to cover your user experience research or if you can amend an existing license to get what you need from it.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

## Key points

### Storing data about users safely and securely

- Be sure to follow any institutional or organizational policies or procedures ove the general advice found here.
- Be careful to understand the purpose of the data you are collecting and ensure that you're not collecting data you don’t need and what data you do collect you consider the risks of it being made public.
- Users can offer some surprising, honest feedback sometimes that they don’t fully realise could harm them so be sure to ask them if they’d like any information struck from the notes/data or if they want to be careful with certain topics.


### Maintaining a database of user participants for user experience research

- Follow any policies and procedures that are set by any institutions or organizations you are affiliated with.
- Consider what data you will keep secure and what could be made public without any consequences.
- Consider how and where you might store the data and what levels of permissions, abstraction and password protection you need.
- Explore and note down how and when you would re-contact a user participant in the future for any further user experience research.


### Ethical user experience research

- Follow any institution or organization ethics and/or morals procedures ahead of additional ones of your own.
- Consider where  ethics and morals might arise in your open source science projects. Think about how you might respond to or mitigate any of these occurrences and ensure you are taking care of yourself and user participants' health and wellbeing.


### Keeping understandable and accessible notes

- Best practices for accessible and understandable notes can be summarised as ensuring you are using different text styles for different kinds of structure and data in your writing.
- Ensure that your files can be accessed without payment/login/internet connection.
- Maintaining a glossary will help you and anyone else who explores your user experience research in the future.


### Open source user experience research

- Making your user experience research open and open source can offer benefits such as allowing your users and contributors to follow essential development in your open source science software without needing to directly ask you which can boost trust and contributions.
- Be sure to check over your open source licenses and make sure you’re happy that an existing license covers what you need it to do for your user experience research or consider another license or an amendment to a license for you to be happy.
